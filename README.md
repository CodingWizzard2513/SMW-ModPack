# SMW-ModPack
An asm project for Super Mario World that contains many different cheats and codes.


## Instructions

_**Warning** if the following instructions are not performed correctly, there is a small chance you will corrupt your rom. Please make sure you've made a backup of your rom just in case anything goes wrong_

To Install, open your fresh, new SMW rom in Lunar Magic. Go to file > Expand Rom > and then expand your rom to at least 2mb.

Then, save your rom and close out of lunar magic.

Next, open the "modpack_defs.asm" file in any text editor and configure (Configuration instructions inside). Remember to set "!iRead" to one or the patch won't work.

If you want to use the music mods, also configure the "Important Music Settings" in the same file.

Save the file and close out of notepad. Launch Asar and patch your rom with the file "modpack.asm".

If you are using the music mods and are not using AddmusicK, Launch asar and patch your rom with "Music_Patches.asm".
